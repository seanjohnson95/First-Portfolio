I am 25 years old and a graduate of Middle Tennessee State Univeristy. I received by Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management in 2018. Since then, I have worked within the healthcare sector. Primarly the mental health sector. I am currently working in addiction medicine, advancing the cause against the opioid crisis. I enrolled in Vanderbilt's coding bootcamp to advance my skill set. I am eager to put the skills I have learned, and will continue to learn to the test within a team. In my free time I enjoy working out and playing music. I am a self taught guitarist and enjoy practicing whenever I get the chance.
